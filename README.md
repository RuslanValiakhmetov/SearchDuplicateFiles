# SearchDuplicateFiles
This small programm allows to find all duplicate files in two directories and their subdirectories.

This project was implemented by using of design patterns such as strategy and template method:
- strategy pattern is using for searching of duplicate files by name or by content;
- template method pattern is using for defining of base behavoir of the search thus allowing to redefine some of its steps in subclasses.
